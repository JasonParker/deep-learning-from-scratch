# Chapter 1: Foundations

"The aim of this chapter is to explain some foundational mental models that are essential for understanding how neural networks work. Specifically, we'll cover *nested mathematical functions and their derivatives*."

For foundational concepts, we'll introduce via three perspectives:
1. Math, in the form of equations
2. Code, with as little extra syntax as possible
3. A diagram explaining what is going on

"one of the challenges of understanding neural networks is that it requires multiple mental models"
